# GuShell
Lightweight and open source reverse shell client and connection manager built for windows. (Named after a cat.)
# Purpose and Usage
This tool is built for educational purposes only, and out of my own curiousity. The only component currently included is the connection manager,
which should *seamlessly* integrate with the typical reverse shell (similar to nc). The client, which I have not built yet, will be built with the features
of changing between command line processes and executing custom code on the client machine (like a very similar tool, but in a lighter and jankier format).

As I said before, this is a fun project for those interested in learning low level concepts, development in cybersecurity, and networking! Contributions are heavily appreciated!
# Starting Points
- Check for dropped client connections
- Give it some more style!
